# Terraform up and running

# Introduction

This repository is a collection of Terraform code that I have written while reading the book [Terraform: Up and Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/). The code is organized by chapter and is intended to be used with the book.

# Usage

Each chapter has its own directory. Each directory contains a `README.md` file that describes the code in the directory. Each directory also contains a `main.tf` file that contains the Terraform code. Some directories also contain a `variables.tf` file that contains the variables used by the code and a `terraform.tfvars` file that contains the values for the variables or a `terraform.tfvars.example` file that contains example values for the variables. There are also some directories that contain modules that are used by the code.
